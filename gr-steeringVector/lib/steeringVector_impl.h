/*
Explanation:
This block applies the expected phase offset between the antennas of an Uniformly spaced linear array. 
When a recalibration signal comes in at an angle less than 90Â°, the phase differences between the antennas should not 
be 0, as the first antenna will receive this signal at a earlier phase than the next one. 


ArraySpacing: Amount of wavelength between two antennas.
ArrayLength: currently equal to position in antenna as block is not dynamically sized. 
vectorLength: length of the vector if not using streams.
refAngle: angle of the transmitter ~ the antenna array.
